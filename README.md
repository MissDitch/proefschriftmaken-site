# proefschriftmaken-site
Prototype for the new Proefschriftmaken website
View this prototype at this url: http://home.kpn.nl/d.geerlings/index.html

I made the design and used Foundation 6 to build this site.
My code consists mainly of HTML and CSS but I also wrote some javascript for hover effects.
The prototype is fully responsive. Check out the section "Hoe wij werken" on the homepage to see how tabs change to accordion on small devices.
